When running svrside_chart_toy1.php, if you receive an Http error 500 or Php
message "Call to undefined function imagecreatetruecolor()". This is likely
because the file "extension=php_gd2.dll" is commented out in the php.ini file.

<p>
Uncomment out this reference in both php.ini file in /Windows and in 
/webroot/php. Then cycle the Apache server.

Note in current builds .095 and later this should not be a problem.
